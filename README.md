# Plant
A simple daemonless wayland notification utility 

TODO: Add Image

# Configuration
Like all suckless software all configuration is done by editing the `src/config.h` file

# Installation
Just a simple
```
sudo make install
```
should build it and copy it to `/usr/local/bin`

# Usage
Just run
```
plant <line 1> <line 2> ...
```
To display the notification

# Improvements
Need make it die after cliking on it

# Inspirations
This project was inspired by [herbe](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/tutorial/step2.html) which was made by a based guy. This is supposed to be the same thing but for Wayland.
